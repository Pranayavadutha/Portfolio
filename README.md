# Portfolio
My portfolio website is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. HTML provides structure, CSS ensures a responsive and visually appealing design, JavaScript adds interactivity, and Bootstrap streamlines the design with a mobile-friendly layout. These technologies combine to create a functional, engaging showcase of my skills.
